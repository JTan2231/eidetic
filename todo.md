# TODO
Potential ideas for implementation

- Infinicraft
  - This is the core of the project, actually
  - Interfaces
    - Drag + drop
    - Chat: "What do you think about the intersection of \<whatever\>?" -> some common theme relating a few different ideas
    - anything else?
  - Crux is a playground for combining different ideas
    - Physically driven design?
